                <h2>LCCC</h2>
                <article>Limerick City and County Council (Comhairle Cathrach agus Contae Luimnigh) is the authority
                    responsible for local
                    government in the City of Limerick and County Limerick. It came into operation on 1st June 2014
                    following from the
                    merger of formerly two separate local authorities – Limerick City Council and Limerick County
                    Council. The amalgamation
                    of both councils was effected under
                    provisions of the Local Government Reform Act 2014.
                    The city and county administration is headed by a Chief Executive, Dr. Pat Daly. Councillor Daniel
                    Butler is the current
                    Mayor of the City and County of Limerick (up to June 2022) and the Council has 40 councillors
                    (elected politicians.
                    Limerick City and County Council covers a geographical area of 2,755 sq.km and, based on latest
                    census data, it has a
                    population of 194,899 persons. The local authority is responsible for services including housing;
                    planning; roads; water
                    supply; environmental protection; provision of recreation and amenities and community
                    infrastructure. Local Authorities
                    play a key role in supporting economic development and enterprise at a local level and in certain
                    aspects of social
                    policies (especially social housing). Recent reforms of local government in Ireland (2014)
                    strengthened the role of
                    local government in economic development and in coordination of a range of public policies that
                    impact on quality of
                    life for people and communities. The organisation’s mission statement is that the local authority
                    will “provide
                    ambitious leadership and strive to deliver an innovative, vibrant, safe and inclusive Limerick for
                    everyone” <br>
                    The vision for the local authority area can be summarised as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>That the people of Limerick are supported by a professional, proactive and accessible local
                            government structure at the
                            heart of a wider public service</li>
                        <li>That Limerick is acknowledged for its inclusive participation of all its citizens in the
                            development of their community
                            and Council services
                        </li>
                        <li>That Limerick offers a real and unique competitive advantage for business development, and
                            an
                            unparalleled quality of
                            life resulting in high quality sustainable homes and communities, cultural enrichment and
                            educational opportunities</li>
                        <li>That Limerick rivals other second tier cities throughout Europe in terms of business,
                            tourism
                            education and investment</li>
                        <li>That Limerick’s new brand identity will unlock advantages and experiences for all of its
                            audiences, making the most of
                            Limerick’s physical and cultural connections</li>
                        <li>That Limerick values the importance of partnership working to improve the health and
                            well-being
                            of our citizens</li>
                        <li>That Limerick is a driver of innovation, harnessing the voice of our people to create a
                            lasting
                            and positive impact on
                            people’s lives.</li>

                <h2>BALLAFON</h2>
                <article>Ballafon was founded in 2006 as a project of Seydou Konate, who arrived in Italy in 1991 from
                    the Ivory Coast, his
                    country of origin. After experiencing firsthand the difficult and sometimes painful status of the
                    migrant, he decided to
                    capitalize on his expertise to facilitate the regularization path and integration of third country
                    nationals.
                    Ballafon is a multicultural cooperative, made up of members from all over the world, which
                    identifies the ethnic and
                    cultural diversity as a core value to be preserved and as a heritage of the entire society. Ballafon
                    offers
                    multidisciplinary activities to promote cultural exchange between populations and their mutual
                    recognition. Liaising
                    with institutional entities, Ballafon acts as the connecting link between them and the migrants,
                    operating on the
                    territory by correctly relaying the local regulations and facilitating the process of regularization
                    and integration of
                    immigrants and supporting them in different phases. Currently Ballafon hosts around 250 migrants
                    from 30 different
                    nationalities and 25 unaccompanied minors in its reception facilities.
                    Ballafon’s mission is to promote integration through cultural, social and economic development in
                    order to guarantee all
                    individuals a decent life without ethnic, religious and political discrimination.
                    <br>

                    Ballafon offers the following services to asylum seekers and migrants:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Orientation and assistance to newcomers</li>

                <article>SYNTHESIS Center for Research and Education is a pioneering organisation which initiates and
                    implements projects of
                    positive social change in the fields of entrepreneurship, civic engagement, digital literacy and

                    One of its success
                    stories is the establishment of “Hub Nicosia,” a co-working centre for organisations with cultural,

                    international
